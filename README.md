### Why are these files excluded?

These files are **auto-generated** and machine-specific — they should never be committed to version control. When someone clones this repo, they are regenerated automatically:

|----------|----------------|
| `build/` | `flutter run` or `flutter build` |
| `.dart_tool/` | `flutter pub get` |
| `.idea/` / `*.iml` | Opening the project in Android Studio or IntelliJ |

> **The app will still work perfectly.** All source code, dependencies, platform configs, and assets are included in the repo. Only temporary build output is excluded.
