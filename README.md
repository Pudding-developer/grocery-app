## 🙈 .gitignore

The project `.gitignore` excludes the following:

| Category | Ignored |
|----------|---------|
| **Miscellaneous** | `*.class`, `*.log`, `*.pyc`, `*.swp`, `.DS_Store`, `.atom/`, `.build/`, `.buildlog/`, `.history`, `.svn/`, `.swiftpm/`, `migrate_working_dir/` |
| **IntelliJ / IDE** | `*.iml`, `*.ipr`, `*.iws`, `.idea/` |
| **Flutter / Dart / Pub** | `**/doc/api/`, `**/ios/Flutter/.last_build_id`, `.dart_tool/`, `.flutter-plugins-dependencies`, `.pub-cache/`, `.pub/`, `/build/`, `/coverage/` |
| **Symbolication** | `app.*.symbols` |
| **Obfuscation** | `app.*.map.json` |
| **Android Studio builds** | `/android/app/debug`, `/android/app/profile`, `/android/app/release` |

> **Note:** The `.vscode/` folder is **not** ignored by default (the rule is commented out) so you can version-control VS Code launch configs if desired.

### Why are these files excluded?

These files are **auto-generated** and machine-specific — they should never be committed to version control. When someone clones this repo, they are regenerated automatically:

| Excluded | Regenerated by |
|----------|----------------|
| `build/` | `flutter run` or `flutter build` |
| `.dart_tool/` | `flutter pub get` |
| `.idea/` / `*.iml` | Opening the project in Android Studio or IntelliJ |

> **The app will still work perfectly.** All source code, dependencies, platform configs, and assets are included in the repo. Only temporary build output is excluded.

## ⚙️ Environment

| Requirement | Version |
|-------------|---------|
| **Dart SDK** | ^3.11.0 |
| **Flutter SDK** | Latest stable (compatible with Dart ^3.11.0) |
